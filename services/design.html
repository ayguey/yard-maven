                <p>
                A good design is more than assembling an eye-catching plant palette.
                It must take into consideration the unique attributes of your garden, such as its
                complex microclimates, soil and water, and above all, your lifestyle.</p>
                <p>
                Do you love entertaining in your backyard, or are you craving a peaceful, cozy retreat?  Do you
                have any children or pets with whom you share your yard?  Are you a hands-on type,
                or are you looking for a garden that practically takes care of itself?</p>
                <p>
                No matter what your needs are, I can help you strike the delicate balance of form and function,
                to create a lasting beauty you will enjoy every day.</p>
