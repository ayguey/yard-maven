                <h2>Maintenance</h2>
                <p>
                Maintenance can make or break a yard.  Just like humans and pets,
                plants need a steady supply of water and nutrition, as well as occasional checkups,
                to be in their best possible shape.</p>
                <p>
                Sadly, however, this is where most other local landscaping professionals fall short.
                My periodic maintenance service encompasses everything your garden needs to stay healthy and beautiful,
                from artful manual pruning which brings out the natural beauty of your plants,
                to customized feeding tailored to each plant's needs, to controlling common pests and diseases.</p>
                <p>
                Let me show you what your yard is really capable of.  You will be amazed by the difference.</p>
